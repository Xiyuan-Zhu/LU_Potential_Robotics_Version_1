LU_Potential_Robotics
This README is designed in a way that assumes that the host has installed Docker and has the latest version of f1tenth_gym_ros

1. Git clone the LU-Potential_Robotics_Version_1 package from https://github.com/Lu-Potential/LU_Potential_Robotics_Version_1.git
into the subfolder /src/f1tenth_gym_ros-master/scripts of your catkin workspace.

2. Make the Lehigh_Ver_1.py file an executable

3. Create a path in the Home folder called "~/rcws/logs/" or path name of your choice 
(This direction was taken from the readme.md file in the particle_filter package)
and move the .csv file into the 'logs' folder.

4. Build and start a docker container

5. In a different terminal, catkin_make, source devel/setup.bash, and run:
    $roslaunch f1tenth_gym_ros lu_kinetic_version_1.launch
